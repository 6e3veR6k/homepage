# Project Details

## Resume for American media personality and businessman who served as the 45th president of the United States from 2017 to 2021.

The r√©sum√© is usually one of the first items, along with a cover letter and sometimes an application for employment, which a potential employer sees regarding the job seeker and is typically used to screen applicants. **The goal of this project is to create an online version of the r√©sum√© using HTML, CSS, and the minimum amount of JavaScript.**

## What is r√©sum√©

In many contexts, a r√©sum√© is typically limited to one or two pages of size A4 or letter-size, highlighting only those experiences and qualifications that the author considers most relevant to the desired position. Many r√©sum√©s contain keywords or skills that potential employers are looking for via applicant tracking systems, make heavy use of active verbs, and display content in a flattering manner. Acronyms and credentials after the applicant's name should be spelled out fully in the appropriate section of the r√©sum√© to increase the likelihood they are found in a computerized keyword scan.[9]

A r√©sum√© is a marketing tool in which the content should be adapted to suit each individual job application or applications aimed at a particular industry. The transmission of r√©sum√©s directly to employers became increasingly popular as late as 2002.[citation needed] Job seekers were able to circumvent the job application process and reach employers through direct email contact and r√©sum√© blasting, a term meaning the mass distribution of r√©sum√©s to increase personal visibility within the job market. However, the mass distribution of r√©sum√©s to employers can often have a negative effect on the applicant's chances of securing employment as the r√©sum√©s tend not to be tailored for the specific positions the applicant is applying for. It is usually, therefore, more sensible to optimize the r√©sum√© for each position applied for and its keywords. In order to keep track of all experiences, keeping a "master r√©sum√©" document is recommended, providing job seekers with the ability to customize a tailored r√©sum√© while making sure extraneous information is easily accessible for future use if needed.

The complexity or simplicity of various r√©sum√© formats tends to produce results varying from person to person, for the occupation, and to the industry. R√©sum√©s or CVs used by medical professionals, professors, artists, and people in other specialized fields may be comparatively longer. For example, an artist's r√©sum√©, typically excluding any non-art-related employment, may include extensive lists of solo and group exhibitions.
